zipper is a full-featured asset packaging plugin for Maven that aims to 
optimize your project's static resources at build time.  Most of the 
heavy lifting is done with Google's Closure Compiler and Yahoo's YUI 
compressor, but you'll also find CSS/JavaScript concatenation and 
gzipping, resource cache busting, and automated lint checking.
